# File-Intrusion
File intrusion refers to unauthorized access or modification of files within a system, often by malicious actors seeking to steal, alter, or destroy sensitive data. Detecting file intrusions is critical for maintaining system integrity and involves monitoring file activity, permissions, and access patterns.

## Features

- Monitor file changes and access events
- Log unauthorized access attempts
- Configurable file and directory watchlists
- Example scripts for common use cases
- Easy-to-extend architecture

## Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DAllen65/File-Intrusion.git
cd File-Intrusion
```

Install dependencies (if any):

```bash
# For Python projects
pip install -r requirements.txt

# For Node.js projects
npm install

# For other environments, see the specific setup instructions in the code/examples.
```

## Usage

### Example 1: Basic File Monitoring

```python
from file_intrusion import watch_file

# Watch a specific file for changes
watch_file('/path/to/important.txt')
```

### Example 2: Logging Unauthorized Access

```python
from file_intrusion import IntrusionLogger

logger = IntrusionLogger('/path/to/logfile.log')
logger.start_monitoring('/secure/data')

# Now, any unauthorized access will be logged automatically
```

### Example 3: Directory Watchlist

```python
from file_intrusion import watch_directory

# Watch multiple directories
watch_directory(['/etc', '/var/log', '/home/user/secret'])
```

### Example 4: Command Line Interface

If a CLI tool is provided:

```bash
python cli.py watch /path/to/monitor
```

## Configuration

See the `config.example.json` file for configuration options, such as:

- Directories to monitor
- File extensions to include/exclude
